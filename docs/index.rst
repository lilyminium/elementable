Welcome to elementable's documentation!
=========================================================

Elementable is *another* elements package defined in Python.
It is written to be usable with a number of different unit systems and classes.
At its most minimal, it has no dependencies outside the main Python library.
However, Elementable can be combined with units packages such as OpenFF-Units,
and fun subclasses such as Pydantic.
