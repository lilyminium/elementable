Welcome to elementary's documentation!
=========================================================

Elementary is *another* elements package defined in Python.
It is written to be usable with a number of different unit systems and classes.
At its most minimal, it has no dependencies outside the main Python library.
However, Elementary can be combined with units packages and
fun subclasses such as Pydantic.
